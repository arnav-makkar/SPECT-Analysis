## 2. SBR Calculation Methodology

### 2.1 PPMI Protocol Implementation
Following the official PPMI methodology document, we implemented:

1. **ROI Definition**: Automated placement of regions of interest
   - Left/Right Putamen
   - Left/Right Caudate
   - Occipital Cortex (reference region)

2. **SBR Formula**: `(target region / reference region) - 1`
   - Target regions: Striatal structures (putamen, caudate)
   - Reference region: Occipital cortex

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Individual SBR values for each striatal region
   - Combined left/right striatal SBR
   - Overall striatal SBR
